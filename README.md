# Archytee_website-with-Django- (https://github.com/Gabriel-Yashim/Archytee_website-with-Django-/)
A web development project for an Architectural design firm.  HTML, CSS and JS
I built this website in initially with just the three basic technologies for web development `(HTML, CSS and JavaScript)` as a static website for my Place of Primary Assignment (PPA) during my NYSC in FCT-Abuja Nigeria.
I Deployed the website temporarily on Vercel <a href="https://archytee-website.vercel.app/">here</a>

But after creating the website, the project requirement changed, and they wanted a dynamic website where they can make changes to the contents of the website without having to go through my codes. After much thought, I decided to add Django, a python framework for both Front-end and Back-end web development. I had to learn Django to be able to achieve this and it was pretty wasy to flow with since I have a goo knowledge of python. I was able to:
<ul>
<li>create an admin dashboard where changes can be made to the contents of the website without going through the codes</li>
<li>I made use of dynamic pages, that is, using the same web page but loading different content based on the data in the database.</li>
<li>I was able to make use of less code and reduce a lot of duplicate codes through the help of templates</li>
</ul>

I created a reppository for the website i created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/Gabriel-Yashim/Archytee_website/">here</a>
